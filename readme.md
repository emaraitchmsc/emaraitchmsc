# Hi, I'm Reza 👋

**MSc Data Science student at UWE Bristol | Data Enthusiast**

Currently building cool data projects and always learning new things. I love transforming messy data into actionable insights and exploring the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and real-world impact.

Always up for a new challenge, whether it’s optimizing a pipeline, visualizing results, or experimenting with the latest ML tools.
